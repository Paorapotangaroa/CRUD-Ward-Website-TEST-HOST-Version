This was a website I hosted for a client. It was originally called TEST HOST because I hosted it to test Heroku. It hosted flawlessly on almost the first try so I left the name. This was used to show my students how to host on Heroku. Sure miss the free-tier days.

This was built prior to taking 2 Cybersecurity classes so I could only hard code users. I now know how to build a DB table, hash passwords, and use JWTs. There are much more elegant ways to accomplish these tasks but I did not know them at the time I built this site.
